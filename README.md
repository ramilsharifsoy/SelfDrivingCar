# Self Driving Car

Connected, Autonomous, Shared and Electric Transportation !!!

We want to live as close as we can get to our offices, places of entertainment and our personal points of interest. Main reason is to avoid commute and have feeling of closeness to our favorite places and people. This choice comes with sacrifice of the dream environment that we would prefer to live. What if we could make distance between our favorite place to live and points of interest shorter that ever? 

Ultimate network of autonomous vehicles will get us closer to our needs and further to your natural environment.
