## Project 2: Traffic Sign Classification
Utilize deep neural networks to classify different traffic signs

## Project 3: Behavioral_Cloning
Train deep neural network to drive car like me.

## Project 4: Advanced Lane Detection
Detect lane markings on the road in more challnaging conditions, such as chnaging road surface, curved roads etc.

## Project 5: Vehicle Detection and Tracking
Detect and track vehicles using color and gradient features and a support vector machine classifier

### End Note
We want to live as close as we can get to our offices, places of entertainment and our personal points of interest. Main reason is to avoid commute and have feeling of closeness to our favorite places and people. This choice comes with sacrifice of the dream environment that we would prefer to live. What if we could make distance between our favorite place to live and points of interest shorter that ever? 

Ultimate network of autonomous vehicles will get us closer to our needs and further to your natural environment.
